EVENT: On 17Dec2018 during the WASH phase of the 'Product 1219' Bay 4 Operations recipe, RY_B4_OPS_MRA_G6 (Product: 10180070 Lot: 3288549 Order: 14110213400), the recipe went into HOLD at 0342 due to a BF_SPEC_SHUTDOWN_ALM alarm for high conductivity. {color} At the time of the HOLD event, the Bay 4 column resin was loaded with product, and the column was being flushed with hydroxyapatite (HAP) equilibration 2 buffer (SOLN6). Per recipe automation, the conductivity range for SOLN6 is 0.925-1.114 mS/cm. This event is the second instance for this phase. 

FINAL CAUSAL ANALYSIS: The direct cause of this event is inadequate standardization of the conductivity probes/meters AI7723.02 and AI7723.06. Possible causes for buffer not getting into the target conductivity buffer range of 0.925-1.114mS/cm are poor standardization of the conductivity probes during the associate Bay 4 Pre-Use recipe, temperature fluctuation in the cleanroom, and/or insufficient time allowed for buffer to get into specification. Per Building Automation System activity report no A6 temperature alarm excursions occurred in Recovery from 16Dec2018 to 18Dec2018. Since the HAP equilibration 2 buffer was within specification when it was formulated, and after the third restart the buffer came into the target specification, the BF_SPEC_SHUTDOWN alarm is not due to the buffer itself, but more than likely due to the standardization of the conductivity probes/meters AI7723.02 and AI7723.06. The root cause of this event is 'Person Name'.

REMEDIATION ACTIONS: To mitigate this error, the operator involved in the event was counseled by his direct supervisor on the importance of the process of standardizing meters in preparation for operations, and that if any anomalies are noted, a work notification should be submitted to evaluate the equipment. No additional actions are required. Should they occur, future events will continue to be monitored and assessed via the discrepancy management.
